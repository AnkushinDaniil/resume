## Summary
I'm a software developer who's passionate about improving blockchain technology to make the world a better place.


## Skills
- Programming Languages: Go, Solidity, Typescript, Python
- Tools: git, docker

## Projects
- ### Website for tattoo studio: [backend](https://github.com/AnkushinDaniil/webStudio/tree/main), [React frontend](https://github.com/AnkushinDaniil/webStudioFrontend), [smart contract](https://github.com/AnkushinDaniil/studio)
  #### Go, Docker, PostgreSQL, React, TypeScript, Solidity, Hardhat
  - This website is developed for tattoo masters to book timeslots in the tattoo studio with the ability to pay by ETH and book timeslots using Ethereum storage.
  - Implemented clean architecture and REST principles in backend development
  - Applied feature-sliced design to front-end development
  - Developed a smart contract

- ### [NFT factory](https://github.com/AnkushinDaniil/hardhat-nft)
  #### Solidity, JavaScript, hardhat
  This is a smart contract to mint NFTs and store them on [NFT storage](https://nft.storage/) 
- ### [DEFI smart contract to interact with AAVE](https://github.com/AnkushinDaniil/hardhat-defi)
  #### Solidity, JavaScript, hardhat 
  This is a project that allows users to lend and borrow using AAVE
- ### [Decentralized lottery on etherium](https://github.com/AnkushinDaniil/hardhat-smartcontract-lottery)
  #### Solidity, JavaScript, hardhat
  This is a smart contract enabling players to participate in a trustless, decentralized lottery 
    
- ### Birefringence dispersion compensation algorithm
  #### Python
  - Conducted research on birefringence dispersion
  - Developed a mathematical model solution
  - Designed and implemented an algorithm to solve this problem in practice (Python)
  - The visibility peaks can now be detected more accurately. The spatial resolution has been improved by 600%, and the accuracy has been improved by 1000%.
  - Compensated single and weakly superimposed vision peaks without losing information. Achieved a spatial resolution of 32 cm and an accuracy of 4 cm.
  - The results were obtained on ESC-4 fiber with $‚àÜùê∑‚âà{0.006 ùëùùë† \over (ùëòùëö‚àôùëõùëö)}$ and a fiber length of $582 m$, but they can be scaled to other types of PMF.
  - **Rewards**:
    - Winner of the Student Startup Grant Competition: Results, ‚Ññ19, [original](https://www.fasie.ru/upload/docs/Sts_results_1.pdf), [translation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b2-dH1GrnPDwWHw270QvpgjlqzL_uNIC5BLyGQY69bg/edit?usp=sharing)
    - Winner of the nomination "For the best report by a young scientist": [original](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-zLvct8xOBqMuRvexu-b0ni1SHmA6ztR/view?usp=sharing), [translation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nANREi2h_vbZ0e8Asc91H2oPNt16DD5GyavvO2hpVrg/edit?usp=sharing)

- ### Automatic algorithm for detection and classification of microparticles on digital axial holograms
  #### Python
  - Captured many digital holograms of transparent microparticles
  - Created a unique dataset of marked and classified microparticles on digital holograms
  - Designed and implemented convolutional neural network for microparticle detection and classification (Python)
  
- ### [Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA) production for fiber optic communication line](https://xn--e1ahdckegffejda6k5a1a.xn--p1ai/en/)
  - EDFA is used instead of repeater to increase small signal due to fiber losses. 
  - Researched EDFA production process, resulting in 300% improvement in production efficiency and 1000% improvement in reliability.
  - Trained over 10 new employees
