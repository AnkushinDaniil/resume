## Summary
Fullstack (web2), smart contracts, physical computation algorithms, neural networks, production automation and optimization development.

## Skills
- Programming Languages: go, solidity, typescript, python
- Tools: git, docker
- Methodologies: clean archiecture, feature-sliced design

## Projects
- ### Fullstack project for tattoo studio: [backend](https://github.com/AnkushinDaniil/webStudio/tree/main), [React frontend](https://github.com/AnkushinDaniil/webStudioFrontend), [smart contract](https://github.com/AnkushinDaniil/studio)
  This project allows tattoo masters to register and book time slots for tattoo sessions via the website or smart contract.
  - ### [Erbium doped amplifiers production for fiber-optic communication line](https://xn--e1ahdckegffejda6k5a1a.xn--p1ai/en/)
The purpose of this project is to provide fiber optic Internet connection between Murmansk and Vladivostok.
- ### Distributed polarization crosstalk (X-Talk) analyzer (birefringence dispersion compensation algorithm development)
This project is my master's thesis and its goal is to create an algorithm to compensate for negative nonlinear effect in PM fibers. 
- ### Automatic algorithm for detection and classification of microparticles on digital axial holograms
  The unique feature of the combination of these technologies is the ability to detect transparent microparticles in water in 3D.
